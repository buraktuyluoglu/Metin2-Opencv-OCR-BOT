# Metin2-Opencv-OCR-BOT
metin2bot using opencv library and ocr modul
for metin-bot, i used it in different metin2 pvp servers, and worked fine.
it also has bot detection, and passes the bot, but it can only pass if they have same bot protection
you look the sabit.png to check if your pvp uses the same protection.
it is not injects metin2 files, so it's not cheat or dangerous.
but there is always a issue that you may be banned for using bot.
so it is your responsibility to use it or not.
